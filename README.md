Clean Blog Project
Clean Blog is a simple blog application built with Node.js and Express.js to practice backend development concepts through a real-world style project.
The project uses EJS as a template engine for server-side rendering, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose for data modeling.
The application is structured using the MVC architecture to keep the codebase clean, modular, and maintainable.
Core features include routing with Express, middleware usage, CRUD operations, and pagination for blog posts. 
During development, tools like Nodemon and Prettier are used to improve productivity and code consistency. 
The project is designed to reflect common patterns used in modern Node.js backend applications.
